# System Design Decisions

This document records the key design decisions made for the Spectra project.

## 1. Backend Framework

**Decision:** Use **.NET Aspire** as the primary backend framework.

**Rationale:**

*   **Cloud-Native Focus:** .NET Aspire is designed specifically for building observable, production-ready, and distributed applications, aligning with our goal of creating a cloud-native image sharing platform.
*   **Simplified Orchestration:** Aspire provides built-in features for service discovery, resilience, and configuration, which simplifies the development and local orchestration of microservices. This is particularly beneficial given our microservice architecture outlined in `ARCHITECTURE.md`.
*   **Developer Productivity:** Leverages the extensive .NET ecosystem, C# language features, and a familiar development experience for .NET developers, potentially speeding up development.
*   **Integration with Azure:** Seamless integration with Azure services (as indicated in `REQUIREMENTS.md` EIR5.3.1 - EIR5.3.4) like Azure AD B2C, Azure Blob Storage, Azure Cosmos DB/SQL Database, and Azure Functions. Aspire facilitates the configuration and connection to these resources.
*   **Observability:** .NET Aspire applications are observable by default, making it easier to monitor, log, and trace application behavior, which is crucial for maintaining system health (MAINT5.4) and troubleshooting (REL3.4).

**Alternatives Considered:**

*   **Node.js (Express/NestJS):** While excellent for I/O-bound tasks and offering a large JavaScript ecosystem, the team's existing .NET expertise and Aspire's tailored features for .NET cloud-native development made .NET Aspire a more strategic choice.
*   **Python (Django/Flask):** Strong for rapid development and data science, but again, not as aligned with the existing .NET ecosystem focus and Aspire's specific benefits.

## 2. Frontend Framework

**Decision:** Use **React** as the frontend framework.

**Rationale:**

*   **Component-Based Architecture:** React's component model promotes reusability and modularity, leading to a more maintainable and scalable frontend codebase (MAINT5.1, MAINT5.2).
*   **Large Ecosystem and Community:** A vast collection of libraries, tools, and a strong community support makes it easier to find solutions and experienced developers.
*   **Performance:** Virtual DOM and efficient update mechanisms contribute to good rendering performance, helping meet responsiveness requirements (PERF1.1, USAB2.1).
*   **Declarative UI:** Simplifies the process of building complex user interfaces and managing application state.
*   **Compatibility with .NET Backend:** React can be effectively integrated with .NET backends, often through RESTful APIs (EIR5.2.1).

**Alternatives Considered:**

*   **Angular:** A comprehensive framework, but can have a steeper learning curve and is more opinionated than React.
*   **Vue.js:** Known for its simplicity and ease of integration, but React's larger ecosystem and job market presence were considered more advantageous for this project.
*   **Blazor WebAssembly:** While offering a full-stack .NET experience, the decision was made to leverage React for its mature frontend ecosystem and wider adoption for complex UIs.

## 3. Local Development Orchestration

**Decision:** Utilize **.NET Aspire** for local development orchestration.

**Rationale:**

*   **Unified Development Experience:** As we are using .NET Aspire for the backend, using it for local orchestration provides a consistent and streamlined development workflow. Developers can define, configure, and run all backend services and their dependencies from a single manifest.
*   **Simplified Microservice Management:** Aspire's AppHost project makes it easy to manage multiple microservices locally, including starting, stopping, and debugging them collectively. This directly supports the microservice architecture outlined in `ARCHITECTURE.MD`.
*   **Service Discovery and Dependencies:** Aspire handles local service discovery and dependency injection (e.g., connection strings for databases, URLs for other services) automatically, reducing manual configuration efforts and potential errors.
*   **Dashboard:** The Aspire dashboard provides a valuable overview of running services, logs, and traces locally, aiding in debugging and understanding inter-service communication.
*   **Alignment with Production:** While not a production runtime itself (Kubernetes is planned for that, as per `ARCHITECTURE.MD`), Aspire helps define the application structure in a way that is more easily translated to production deployment manifests.

**Alternatives Considered:**

*   **Docker Compose:** A common and effective tool for orchestrating containers locally. However, .NET Aspire provides a more integrated experience specifically tailored to .NET development, with features like automatic .NET project referencing and built-in dashboarding that Docker Compose alone doesn't offer out-of-the-box for .NET projects.
*   **Minikube/Kind (Local Kubernetes):** While these provide a full Kubernetes environment locally, they can be more resource-intensive and have a steeper setup curve for purely local development iterations compared to Aspire's lightweight orchestration. Aspire can simplify the path *to* Kubernetes.

## 4. Key Architectural Patterns & Decisions

*   **Microservices Architecture:** As detailed in `ARCHITECTURE.md`, the backend will be composed of several independent microservices (e.g., Image Service, User Profile Service).
    *   **Reason:** Enhances scalability (SCAL6.1), maintainability (MAINT5.2), and allows for independent deployment and technology choices (if needed in the future) for different services.
*   **API Gateway (Azure API Management):** As per `ARCHITECTURE.md`.
    *   **Reason:** Centralizes cross-cutting concerns like authentication, rate limiting, routing, and provides a stable interface for the frontend (EIR5.2.1).
*   **Externalized Identity Management (Azure AD B2C):** As per `REQUIREMENTS.md` (EIR5.3.1) and `ARCHITECTURE.md`.
    *   **Reason:** Leverages a robust, secure, and scalable identity solution, offloading complex identity management from the application.
*   **Asynchronous Operations (Azure Functions):** For tasks like image post-processing or notifications, as mentioned in `REQUIREMENTS.md` (EIR5.3.4).
    *   **Reason:** Improves application responsiveness by offloading long-running or non-critical tasks to background processes (PERF1.2, PERF1.3).
*   **Cloud Storage for Images (Azure Blob Storage):** As per `REQUIREMENTS.md` (EIR5.3.2) and `ARCHITECTURE.md`.
    *   **Reason:** Provides a durable, scalable, and cost-effective solution for storing large binary files (IR2.1).
*   **Database Choice (Azure Cosmos DB or Azure SQL Database):** As per `REQUIREMENTS.md` (EIR5.3.3) and `ARCHITECTURE.md`. The specific choice per microservice may vary.
    *   **Reason:** Offers scalable and reliable data persistence. The choice between NoSQL (Cosmos DB) and relational (SQL Database) will depend on the specific data structure and query patterns of each microservice (SCAL6.2). For example, user profiles and social graphs might benefit from a NoSQL model, while transactional data might be better suited for a relational database.

## 5. Future Considerations / To Be Decided (TBD)

*   **Specific Database per Microservice:** While the options are Azure Cosmos DB and Azure SQL, the final choice for each microservice needs to be detailed based on its specific data model and access patterns.
*   **Caching Strategy:** Detailed caching mechanisms (e.g., CDN for images, Redis for API responses or session data) to further improve performance (PERF1.1).
*   **Detailed CI/CD Pipeline Implementation:** Specific tools and configurations for the CI/CD pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions workflows, Azure DevOps Pipelines).
*   **Monitoring and Alerting Details:** Specific metrics to monitor and alerting thresholds using Azure Monitor (MONITORING_AND_LOGGING.md).
