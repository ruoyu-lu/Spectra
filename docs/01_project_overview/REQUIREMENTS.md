## 4. Non-Functional Requirements
### 4.1 Performance
- [ ] PERF1.1 (Page Load): As a user, I want main pages (Feed, Profile, Image Detail) to load in under 3 seconds on a typical mobile network, so that I don't experience frustrating delays.
- [ ] PERF1.2 (Image Upload Speed): As a user, I want a 2MB image to upload and its processing to complete (showing success) within 10 seconds, so that sharing content is a quick experience.
- [ ] PERF1.3 (API Responsiveness): As a user, I want the application to feel responsive when I perform actions, which means core backend operations should complete quickly (target 95% of API calls < 500ms server-side).
- [ ] PERF1.4 (Concurrency - MVP): As a user, I want the platform to remain responsive even if up to 50 other users are using it simultaneously (on MVP infrastructure), so that the service is usable during initial peak times.

### 4.2 Usability

- [ ] USAB2.2 (Responsive Design): As a user, I want the platform to display correctly and be fully functional on my desktop and mobile browsers, so that I can access it seamlessly from any of my devices.
- [ ] USAB2.3 (User Feedback): As a user, I want to receive clear and timely visual feedback for my actions (e.g., loading indicators, success/error messages), so that I always know the status of my interactions.

### 4.3 Reliability
- [ ] REL3.1 (System Uptime - MVP): As a user, I want the core features of the platform to be available at least 99% of the time, so that I can rely on it to access and share content.
- [ ] REL3.2 (Data Consistency): As a user, I want my actions (likes, comments, follows, uploads) to be accurately and promptly reflected across the platform, so that I can trust the information displayed.
- [ ] REL3.3 (Graceful Error Handling): As a user, I want the system to handle errors gracefully and provide helpful messages instead of crashing or showing cryptic errors, so that my experience is not abruptly disrupted.
- [ ] REL3.4 (Admin Error Insight): As an administrator, I want the system to handle errors in a way that minimizes service disruption and provides sufficient information for troubleshooting, so that I can maintain system health.

### 4.4 Security
- [ ] SEC4.1 (Authenticated Access): As a user, I want my personal data and ability to perform actions (like posting or deleting) to be protected by requiring me to be logged in, so that only I can control my account.
- [ ] SEC4.2 (Secure Transmission): As a user, I want my sensitive data (like passwords during login) to be encrypted during transmission (HTTPS), so that it cannot be intercepted by malicious actors.
- [ ] SEC4.3 (Secure Storage): As a user, I want my password to be stored securely (e.g., hashed and salted) and my sensitive personal information to be protected, so that my data remains safe even if the system's storage is compromised.
- [ ] SEC4.4 (Access Control): As a user, I want to be sure that I can only access and modify my own private data and content, and that others cannot access it unless I have made it public, so that my privacy is maintained.
- [ ] SEC4.5 (Vulnerability Protection): As a user, I want the platform to be protected against common web vulnerabilities (e.g., XSS, CSRF, SQL Injection), so that my account and data are secure from attacks.
- [ ] SEC4.6 (Admin Security Focus): As an administrator, I want the system to be built with security best practices to protect against common vulnerabilities, so that the platform's integrity and all user data are safeguarded.

### 4.5 Maintainability
- [ ] MAINT5.1 (Readable Code): As a developer, I want the codebase to follow consistent coding standards and be well-commented where necessary, so that it is easy to understand, debug, and modify by any team member.
- [ ] MAINT5.2 (Modular Architecture): As a developer, I want the system to have a modular design (e.g., microservices encouraged by .NET Aspire) with low coupling, so that changes in one area have minimal impact on others and new features can be integrated more easily.
- [ ] MAINT5.3 (Clear Documentation): As a developer, I want key architectural decisions, complex logic, and API contracts to be well-documented, so that the system is easier to understand and maintain over time.
- [ ] MAINT5.4 (Effective Logging): As a developer/administrator, I want the system to log key operations, errors, and performance metrics comprehensively, so that I can effectively troubleshoot issues, monitor system health, and understand usage patterns.

### 4.6 Scalability
- [ ] SCAL6.1 (Handle Growth): As an administrator/business owner, I want the application architecture to support horizontal scaling (e.g., by adding more server instances), so that the platform can efficiently handle a growing number of users and increasing traffic without performance degradation.
- [ ] SCAL6.2 (Database Growth): As an administrator/business owner, I want the chosen database solution to be scalable, so that it can accommodate increasing amounts of user data, images, and interactions over time.

### 4.7 Compatibility
- [ ] COMP7.1 (Browser Support): As a user, I want the web application to function correctly and look good on the latest two versions of major modern browsers (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari), so that I can use my preferred browser without issues.

## 5. External Interface Requirements
### 5.1 User Interface (UI)
- [ ] EIR5.1.1: As a user, I want to interact with the platform primarily through a web browser, so that it is easily accessible from various devices without requiring a separate application installation.
- [ ] EIR5.1.2: As a user, I want the interface to be clean, visually appealing, and follow modern design conventions for social media applications, so that my experience is enjoyable and intuitive.

### 5.2 Application Programming Interface (API)
- [ ] EIR5.2.1: As a frontend developer, I want a well-defined and documented RESTful API to communicate with the backend services, so that I can efficiently build and maintain the user interface.
- [ ] EIR5.2.2: As a (backend/API) developer, I want the API to adhere to OpenAPI specifications and provide comprehensive documentation (e.g., via Swagger/Swashbuckle), so that it is easy for clients (including the frontend) to understand and integrate with.
- [ ] EIR5.2.3: As a developer, I want the API to implement a versioning strategy, so that future enhancements and changes can be rolled out smoothly without breaking existing client integrations.

### 5.3 External Service Interfaces
- [ ] EIR5.3.1: As a developer, I want the system to integrate seamlessly with Azure AD B2C for user authentication and identity management, so that we can leverage a robust, secure, and scalable identity solution.
- [ ] EIR5.3.2: As a developer, I want the system to utilize Azure Blob Storage for storing user-uploaded image files, so that we have a durable, scalable, and cost-effective solution for large object storage.
- [ ] EIR5.3.3: As a developer, I want the system to use PostgreSQL (e.g., Azure Database for PostgreSQL) for persisting application metadata (user profiles, image details, social graphs, comments), so that we have a reliable and scalable database backend.
- [ ] EIR5.3.4: As a developer, I want the system to be able to integrate with Azure Functions for handling asynchronous background tasks (such as image post-processing or notifications), so that these operations do not impact the responsiveness of user-facing services.
